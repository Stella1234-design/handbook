## Grading and entering grades in FlexNow

{: .important }
First, the dean's office books the central courses, then the secretariats are _allowed_ to book their decentralized courses

Before grading (day of the exam)

- Cases of cheating (Unterschleif): immediately enter it into Flexnow and send the exam to the examination office (do not grade it)
- Cases of missed exams (Versäumnisklausuren): immediately enter it into Flexnow, archive the exams for 1 year.
- Send the exam sheets, protocolls (Anwesenheitslisten), and two empty exams to the examination office immediately after the exams are completed.
- Empty exams (Versäumnis-Klausur): archive for one semester.

Grading

- Create reminder for the deadline: approx. 15. September (summer term), ??? (winter term). Grade early because colleagues may be on vacation before the deadline (not available to review failed exams).
- Add bonus points if any and **if exam is passed**. Otherwise, note the bonus points and add a note "kann nicht angerechnet werden".
- Do not dispose of empty exams
- Use the [grading scripts](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/grading) to assign grades and prepare Flexnow import
- Have failed exams reviewed by a second professor
- Grades are entered in [FlexNow](30.15.flexnow.html#entering-grades). Certificates can be issued if exams are not (yer) available in FlexNOW ([script](https://github.com/digital-work-lab/handbook/tree/main/src/scheine))).
