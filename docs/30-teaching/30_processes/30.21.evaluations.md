## Process

- Evaluations can be ordered by **early January / early July**
  - They can be ordered via EvaSys, which requires a **minimum of 5 students** to complete the evaluation. Otherwise, anonymity is not given, and results will not be made available.
  - For small courses, it is possible to use other tools or modes of evaluation.
- Evaluation results and potential improvements should be discussed with students (last week of teaching).
- Students should be reminded in the session and via VC.
- Add to the list of prior reports below.
- The evaluation results are stored in 19.XXXXXX (Nextcloud) and published in the handbook (linked in the table below).
- Evaluations results should be analyzed to improve teaching activities. Improvements are documented in the [30.22 Improvements](30.22.improvements.html) section.
